# Automatic File Sorter
## Description
The goal of that project is to help the user with sorting files by taking into consideration file extension.  

The script is creating a list with every file existing in a folder.  
We are given a list of folders that we want to create and the script is checking if they exist, if not it creates them for us.  
Then the script is checking if the file already exists in the folder and if not it is moving that file to the correct folder.   
After that, it is checking if there are any left files in a folder and return the correct information.  
I also decided to schedule a run of script every hour to automate the whole process.
